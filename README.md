# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my final project for **CS 463/563 â€“ Intro to Web Development** at Portland State University.

##  Project Overview

This is a single-page personal website that introduces myself, highlights my academic experience, showcases selected projects, and provides a contact form. The goal is to demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, while also going beyond the classroom by incorporating additional components and custom styling.

### Key Features
- Responsive design using Bootstrap 5
- About section with image and bio
- Previous Work section with coursework and skills accordion
- Projects section with detailed cards and external links
- Contact form with JavaScript-based validation
- Custom styling for headings, layout, and interactions
